/*
  Serial Call and Response
  Language: Wiring/Arduino

  This program sends an ASCII A (byte of value 65) on startup and repeats that
  until it gets some data in. Then it waits for a byte in the serial port, and
  sends three sensor values whenever it gets a byte in.

  The circuit:
  - potentiometers attached to analog inputs 0 and 1
  - pushbutton attached to digital I/O 2
